# Solvers

There are two types of solvers: **AD-free** solvers, which does not support automatic differentiation but in general more efficient due to less bookkeeping; and **AD-capable** solvers, which has automatic differentiation so you can use them to solve inverse problems.

## AD-free Solvers

AD-free solvers are located in `src/fem/solvers/Solver.jl` and `src/fem/solver/SolverV2.jl`. These solvers are implemented in pure Julia.

Consider a static linear elasticity problem 

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{div}\sigma &= f & (x,y) \in \Omega\\ 
\sigma &= H\epsilon \\ 
u(x,y) &= u_0(x,y) & (x,y) \in \partial \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

on a unit square domain $\Omega$. We can compare the result with PoreFlow.jl.

## AD-capable Solvers

AD-capable solver are located in `src/adutils/solvers.jl`. These solvers are implemented with highly optimized C++ kernels. The usage of these solvers are different from AD-free solvers, where all data structures are wrapped in `domain` and `globaldata`. Here users need to provide variables such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, stress, strain, etc., explicitly to the solvers. To this end, the following utiltity functions are provided: 



* [`compute_boundary_info`](@ref)

* [`compute_external_force`](@ref)

* [`ExplicitSolverTime`](@ref)

* [`GeneralizedAlphaSolverTime`](@ref)

We consider the same linear elasticity problem problem used in AD-free solvers.
